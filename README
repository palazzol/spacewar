Unfortunately, I have not gotten around to packaging spacewar
for totally automatic installation; so here are some notes:

    spacewar.h	contains various pathnames that must be edited
		before compilation.  There is also a define for
		SWMASTER, the player that has special game commands
		and ship privileges. The special game commands
		can be found in prvcmd.c.

    Makefile	must define the right symbols during compilation
		for your system type:
			VMS	for VMS; certain mailbox privileges
				are required.
			BSD	for non System-V.
		If neither of these are defined, then a System-V
		environment with named pipes is assumed.
			VOID	either 'int' or 'void' depending on
				what your compiler supports.
			NEEDFMOD if your system doesn't have an fmod
				function in libc.a or libm.a.

    swobj	should be created by copying swobj.init into it.

    swerr
    swdb.dir
    swdb.pag	should be created empty.

    psw.sh	should be edited for pathnames and installed somewhere
		like /usr/games.

    psw
    sw		should be setuid to the owner of swobj, swdb.dir, swdb.pag,
		and swerr. Also, the directory that these files are in
		must be mode 'rwx' for the same user-id as the setuid cuz
		various other files are created and exist here only while
		spacewar is running.
